          <h2>Welcome to Words to Pages</h2>

<p>There are times when it helps to know how many words per page you're writing. While a general guideline is one page is 500 words (single spaced) or 250 words (double spaced), this is a ballpark figure. The truth is the number of words per page depends on a variety of factors such as the type of font, the font size, spacing elements, margin spacing, and paragraph length to name a few. While it's not possible to take into all these factors when estimating how many words per page there will be for your writing, this calculator can give a more accurate words per page conversion estimate than the typical <a href="https://wordcounter.net/blog/2015/09/18/10655_how-many-pages-is-2000-words.html">250/500 ballpark figure</a>.</p>

<p>The calculator is able to provide a more accurate conversion by taking into account more specific information. For example, you can choose from a different variety of common fonts to generate an estimate:</p>

<ul>
<li> Arial</li>
<li> Calibri</li>
<li> Comic Sans MS</li>
<li> Courier</li>
<li> Times New Roman</li>
<li> Verdana</li>
</ul>

<p>You can then choose your preferred spacing from the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li> Single spaced</li>
<li> 1.5 spaced</li>
<li> Double spaced</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, you can choose your preferred font size: 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14.</p>

<p>By using these three options to more accurately define your writing, the words per page calculator should provide a better estimate on how many words you need to write to fill a page. In the opposite direction, it can give a more accurate estimate of how many pages you have created if you only know the <a href="https://wordcounter.net">word count</a>. </p>

<p>While we make every attempt to make our calculators as accurate as possible, the results won't be perfect. This converter addresses some issues to provide a more accurate estimate, but in the end, it's still an estimate. Other issues such as margin space and paragraph length will likely result in some variation from the calculations given. That being said, it should provide a more accurate indication of the number of pages a specific word count will be and the number of words per page you type when compared to the general rule of thumb.</p>

<p>For general information, the following are calculations using 12-point Arial font, double spaced:</p>
